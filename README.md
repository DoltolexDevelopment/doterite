# doterite
doterite is a game with 1 goal: Make it so asteroids don't completely destroy Earth. Go out into space with your ship and obliterate large asteroids.

It is supposed to be a rewrite to my code [here](https://github.com/DoltolexDevelopment/dotlauncher) but decided to make it into a other game still similar to it.

As you probably can tell, doterite is still in very early development (it literally says prototype in the window title) so don't expect much from it right now.

## Getting Started
You may still want to try to run doterite, so here are some things you need:

Love2D v11.4

### Running the Game
1. Once you have Love2D installed, download this repository.
2. Extract the repository.
3. Drag the extracted folder onto the Love2D executable or shortcut.
4. Play Game!

## Contribution
